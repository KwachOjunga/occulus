It is currently 2025; we are living in the age of AI and 
most things seems obsolete in the face of it.
Occulus, is an attempt to push forward everything that looks solved.
Visualization still relies on vtk; most medical imaging software are hell 
bent on using opencv; while this stands as a testament to the utility of 
models of thinking it also illustrates our inability to come up with 
complete rewrites even in the face of new technology.

The current landscape of technology offers avenues to exploit modern hardware
in our computers using programming models whose designs have been tested and 
have withstood the test of time.

Tracelai has offered an avenue of perfoming high performance computation using
normal language constructs and without being bogged down by the difficulty of 
learning multiple shading languages and spending inordnate time frames in optimization.

Occulus aims to push the envelope in the direction of visualization and performing medical
imaging computations. These are the phases it will go through:
    (i) Having a functional prototype - This will tease out the existing infrastructure in the field 
        and gain a feel for what is actually possible.
    (ii) Rewriting existing libraries while creating new performance capabilities - This phase is 
        the core objective of the exercise and it will involve rebuilding parts of libraries like 
        vtk and opencv and also adopting different paradigms of conceptualizing the problems they 
        attempted to solve.
    (iii) Optimize the rewritten libraries to have higher performance capabilities.

My working hypothesis is that doing this will offer the field with software that has characteristics of 
high portability and maintability.
